\subsection{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}
%As you can see, our stages imply the use of cryptography,  and security protocol techniques. 
% The following two sub-sections describe the notation used in the rest of
% the document. 

% \subsubsection{Host level notation}
% \label{sec:hostLevel}
Our notation has some similarities with Burrows et.al.~\cite{Burrows1990}. 
Table~\ref{table:conventions} summarizes our notation. Let start with
cryptography, it has two main mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Symmetric cryptography, the same key is used to encode and
    decode a message; by convention, symbol $\fat{m}_{K_{AB}}$ will be
    used to denote that a message $m$ has been cyphered under the key
    $K_{AB}$, which agents $A$ and $B$ know. \footnote{An agent is a 
        computer process that uses the client-server technology to 
        establish a network communication. Sometimes we will use the 
        terms agent or client indistinctly.} 
  \item Asymmetric cryptography, two keys are used to encode and
    decode messages; an agent (e.g. $A$) has a key pair
    (public $K_{pub(A)}$ and private $K_{priv(A)}$). One key used to
    encode and the other one to decode (reciprocally); usually, key
    $K_{priv(A)}$ is kept in secret. 
\end{itemize}

$m1\lnk m2$         &  $m1$ and $m2$ are concatenated using symbol $\lnk$ \\
$[m_1:: m_2]$       &  A list o messages, $m_1$ representing the first element\\
$N_a$, $N_b$, $N_c$ &  Nonces, which are random unguessable numbers      \\
                    &  never been used before.                           \\ \hline \hline

% \subsubsection{Notation at network level}
% \label{sec:networkLevel}
Table~\ref{table:NetConventions} describes the notation in the Client-Server communication.
Our model is compound by various security protocols. A security protocol is formed by the 
initial knowledge of the participant agents and a set of message steps. Each step consists in  
sending or receiving messages under the Client-Server technology. Before sending a message,
an agent can execute an operation (maybe dependent of the previous received message), as part 
of a local process.

%three views (see ): i) initial knowledge;
%ii) message sending and message reception; and iii) the local process
%representation.
