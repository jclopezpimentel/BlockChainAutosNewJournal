%Blockchain technology, from its emergence until now, has been applied to several projects and 
%not just for cryptocurrencies. 
%Although this technology has been used for several challenges, to our knowledge, there are no 
%records of having applied it to smart properties in vehicles.
%In this work, we present a transaction based solution to handle motorized vehicles ownership 
%and provenance. 
%The solution is based on a distributed model using smart properties and blockchain technologies,  
%which offers a secure and useful system where transactions can be requested to handle, 
%validate and update the vehicle information. 
%The model includes the specification of various client-server security protocols.  
%The client can have different roles accordingly to the relationship it has with the 
%physical property and it can get services and request transactions;
%meanwhile the \blockchaincarnetwork  acts as the server entity. 
%%Some transaction examples are shown. 
%We believe that our proposal can contribute to reduce frauds and increase the trend of 
%paperless culture that is strongly being promoted in recent years.

We present a transaction based solution to handle motorized vehicles ownership 
and provenance over a distributed model using smart contracts,  
including the specification of client-server security protocols,
roles, services, transactions and the \blockchaincarnetwork acting as server.
Our proposal will reduce frauds and increase the trend of paperless culture.
