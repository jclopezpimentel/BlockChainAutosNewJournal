\subsection{Proposal}
\label{subsec:proposal}
In general there exists some characteristics, in the vehicles, we are looking for:
a) Provenance,
b) Transparency with respects to purchase sale,
c) Traceability with history transactions, owners and legal situations (including  
government participation).

To achieve these goals, we have proposed a distributed model illustrated in the context
diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:flowChartFramework}. Such a figure denotes
the general stages (circled numbers) a user must follow to get or set information about a 
vehicle:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Stage I} consists in getting information of a vehicle through reading
    a QR code by any user.
    %or setting the QR code by a dealership. 
    This stage requires that a company generates the genesis block after a vehicle has 
    been manufactured. Details in Section~\ref{ssec:clientServer}.
  \item \textbf{Stage II} consists in establishing a secure channel between any user
    and the \textit{vehicle blockchain network}. We
    have used the TLS protocol because it is the standard in the
    e-commerce and it has been subject to a lot of verification proofs.
    Details in Section~\ref{sec:secureChannel}.
  \item \textbf{Stage III} consists in getting services such as provenance or 
    traceability. Some services require authentication, but others do not.
    Details in Section~\ref{sec:getServices}.  
  \item \textbf{Stage IV:} consists in how to do transactions and what kind of these can 
    do each role (owner, government, dealerships, etc). For example how to build
    the genesis block within the \textit{vehicle blockchain network}. 
    Authentication is required. 
    Details in Section~\ref{sec:transactions}.
