\begin{abstract}
Blockchain technology, from its emergence until now, has been applied to several projects and not just for cryptocurrencies. 
Although this technology has been used for several challenges, to our knowledge, there are no 
records of having applied it to smart properties in vehicles.
We present a transaction based solution to handle motorized vehicles ownership and provenance over a distributed model using smart contracts.
The model includes the specification of various client-server security protocols verified formally using AVISPA-SPAN tool.
The client can have different roles accordingly to the relationship it has with the 
physical property and it can get services and request transactions;
meanwhile the \blockchaincarnetwork  acts as the server entity. 
Our proposal can contribute to reduce frauds and increase the trend of 
paperless culture that is strongly being promoted in recent years.
