\subsection{Client-Server Participants and the QR Code}
\label{ssec:clientServer}
QR code can be read quickly by many modern cell phones. It is used to take a piece of 
information from a transitory media and put it in to your cell phone. 
It may give you details about a URL, vCard, plain text, etc.

Our solution takes into account an application able to read a QR code (i.e. an smartphone).
The application must be able to connect with the \blockchaincarnetwork in order
to do different operations (Table~\ref{table:operations} shows a list of operations). 

In particular, the smartphone application will be denoted as the client $\Client$. 
Such an application, while running, connects with a miner, denoted as \Server, within the \blockchaincarnetwork.


%\subsubsection{Setting a QR Code in a Car}
%\label{sssec:settingQR}
The QR code must be generated by dealerships who manufactures vehicles and they must place the code
in both: physically in some part of the vehicle and virtually in the invoice.

The QR code must content the following data: 
\textit{id=vehicle identification number}, 
\textit{trademark}, 
\textit{model}, 
\textit{class}, 
\textit{version}, 
\textit{number of cylinders}, and
among \textit{others}. These attributes are own of a vehicle, and they do not 
change with time. An example in JSON format is shown in Table~\ref{table:genesisInfo}.
The QR code information is in plain-text because such an information is not sensitive and anyone can obtain such data of any vehicle.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Genesis information about the vehicle}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
       \{&         			&    							\\
         & id:        		& "1FMYU02Z97KA580G2", 			\\
         & tradeMark: 		& "abcd", 						\\
         & model:     		& "2012", 						\\
         & class:     		& "auto", 						\\
         & version:   		& "TA XLS 4X2 I4 TELA 4 CIL", 	\\
         & cylinders: 		& "L4" 							\\
       \}& 		        	& 								\\
       ::& \textit{others}	&								\\
    \end{tabular}
    \label{table:genesisInfo}
\end{table}
